  - [x] Add move delays
  - [x] Implement hints
  - [x] Handle color switching
  - [x] Test AI play

## Phase 4.5: AI Quality Improvement (NEW)
- [ ] Fix critical queen move generation bug (0 legal moves when attacked)
- [ ] Fix AI tactical blindness - misses checkmate in 1 moves
- [ ] Enhance threat detection in evaluation function
- [ ] Fix AI pawn advancement priorities (doesn't push passed pawns)
- [ ] Improve AI piece centralization logic
- [ ] Add AI tests for starting position scenarios
- [ ] Document AI test results and improvement roadmap
- [ ] Rerun AI test suite to verify improvements

## Critical Game Logic Fixes
- [x] Fix pawn promotion bug - promotion not happening at all (FIXED: pawns now promote to queen automatically)

## Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Step 13: Persistence (Prompt 13)
  - [ ] Create js/storage.js

  - [ ] Test features

- [ ] Step 15: Final Integration (Prompt 15)
  - [ ] Integration testing
  - [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Code cleanup
  - [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Final verification

## Testing Checklist
- [x] All pieces move correctly
- [x] Check/checkmate detection works
- [x] Stalemate detection works
- [x] AI makes legal moves
- [ ] AI provides reasonable challenge (FAILING - see AI Quality Issues)
- [ ] AI passes tactical test suite (FAILING - 17/27 tests)
- [ ] AI queen move generation works correctly (FAILING)
- [ ] AI finds checkmate in 1 moves (FAILING)
- [ ] AI prioritizes piece centralization (FAILING)
- [ ] AI pushes passed pawns (FAILING)
- [ ] Save/load works properly
- [ ] Color alternation works
- [x] Pawn promotion works (FIXED - pawns automatically promote to queen)
- [x] UI is responsive
- [x] No console errors
- [ ] Works on mobile
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Known Issues
- **Pawn Promotion Bug**: FIXED - Pawns now promote to queen automatically when reaching last rank
- **AI Queen Move Generation Bug**: Queen shows 0 legal moves when attacked (discovered in test suite)
- **AI Tactical Blindness**: Misses obvious checkmate in 1 moves
- **AI Positional Weakness**: Poor piece centralization and pawn advancement priorities
- **AI Test Results**: Only passes 17/27 strategic tests (63% success rate)
- **Threat Detection**: AI evaluation function needs enhanced threat awareness

## Notes
- Follow prompts in order
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Don't skip ahead
- Each step builds on previous work
